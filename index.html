    <h1 class="display-3">COP-29</h1>
    <p>The 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference or Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, more commonly known
        as COP29, will be the 29th United Nations Climate Change conference. COP29 will be held in Baku, Azerbaijan from <span class="text-info">11 to 22 November</span>
        , 2024. Mukhtar Babayev will preside COP29, while Samir Nuriyev heads the Organising Committee.
        <br>
    <div class="img1"></div>
    The choice of Azerbaijan as the location for the conference is controversial due to its position as a major oil
    and gas producer. Reporters and anti-corruption non-profits have also criticized that the conference is held in
    an authoritarian state with extensive corruption.The "official partners" of COP29 are businesses that are owned
    by ruler Ilham Aliyev's family or have ties to the Aliyev family's businesses.
    </p>
    <p>Azerbaijan signed the Paris Agreement—an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
        Change (UNFCCC)—on April 22, 2016. It was ratified on January 9, 2017, and entered into force on February 8,
        2017, roughly a month later.
        In December 2023, Azerbaijan was announced as the host of the conference. <span class="text-warning">In January 2024</span>, Mukhtar Babayev was
        appointed as COP29 president. The choice of Azerbaijan as the location for COP29 was controversial, as it is
        major fossil fuel exporter and also has an authoritarian government extensively linked to corruption. All the
        companies designated as "official partners" of the conference are either owned by the ruling <span class="text-success">Aliyev family</span> or
        have business ties to the family. The location of the conference is the 500-hectare Sea Breeze complex in Baku,
        which is owned by Emin Agalarov, the former son-in-law of Azerbaijan’s authoritarian president, Ilham Aliyev.
        The Azerbaijan government gave <span class="text-danger">Agalarov</span> a $5.2-million government contract to host COP29 guests without allowing
        others to bid on the contract.
        <br>
    <div class="img2"></div>
    Amnesty International said the Host Country Agreement (HCA) between Azerbaijan and the UNFCCC should include
    arrangements that guarantee that “all human rights are protected and respected”, and must be made public
    immediately, citing Azerbaijan’s human rights violations. The rights group drew a comparison with the situation
    during COP28 that was hosted by the <span class="text-primary">United Arab Emirates</span>, stating that it had made multiple efforts to obtain
    the HCA signed in August 2023. Amnesty received a copy of COP28’s HCA in June 2024, and revealed that it had
    “significant shortcomings and ambiguities” in rights protections offered to the participants in Dubai.</p>
